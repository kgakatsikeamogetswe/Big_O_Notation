## Is Big O Notation important in our lives?

<ins>_Am I the only one who feels like developers these days emphasize clean code more than Big O notation?_</ins>



1. First things first, <ins>let's talk about `clean code`.🌟</ins>

Clean code is crucial when it comes to production. We must strive to write code as clean as possible. However, does clean code guarantee fast program execution? I think not. 🤔

Hey, clean code is undeniably important in our lives, not denying that fact! ✨

Clean code is like the foundation of a sturdy building 🏢 - it forms the basis for everything we build upon it. When we write clean code, we ensure that our programs are easy to understand and maintain. This means fewer bugs 🐛, quicker debugging, and smoother collaboration among team members.

Making sure your code is clean is really important for working well with your team. But it's also important to think about what the client needs. 🤝 Usually, clients want their programs to run fast so they can get things done quickly. But even though speed is important, having clean code is still crucial. 🚀

We need to find a balance between having code that's easy to understand and having code that runs fast. 🧹💨 Clean code helps us read and change our code more easily, which means we can make updates faster and have fewer mistakes. But at the same time, we also need our code to run fast to meet the client's needs. 🕒

To figure out how well our code runs, we can look at something called `Big O notation`. 📈 It helps us understand how efficient our code is and how it scales as we work with bigger datasets.

So, even though we want our code to run fast, it's still really important to keep it clean. This helps us work well with our team and make sure our code lasts a long time. 🌟




2. Last things lasts, <ins>let's talk about `Big O Notation`.🌟</ins>

What is Big O Notation? Big O notation is like a way to talk about how fast an algorithm runs or how much space it needs. 🚀 It helps us understand how our code performs when we have a lot of data.

Imagine you have a list of things to do, and you want to find something in that list. Big O notation tells you how many steps it might take to find what you're looking for as the list gets longer. 📊

For example, if you have 10 things in your list and you need to look through each one, it might take 10 steps. If you have 100 things, it might take 100 steps. Big O notation helps us see how the number of steps grows as the list gets bigger.

Knowing Big O notation is super important for solving computer problems! 🌟 It helps us figure out how fast and efficient our solutions are, so we can make smart choices when solving different kinds of problems.

If someone understands Big O notation, they'll have a great toolkit for tackling algorithmic problems! 💡

Honestly, I'd rather give my client a fast program than worry too much about clean code. 🏃‍♂️ Another reason why many developers struggle in interviews is because they don't know how to approach solving the problem! 🤔 Like, how are you going to figure out the solution if all you've been taught is how to write clean code? 📝

So is Big O Notation important in our lives?Yes, Big O notation is important in our lives! 🌟 It helps us understand how fast our programs run and how much space they need. 💻 This is really helpful when we're working with a lot of data or trying to make our programs more efficient. 🚀 So yeah, it's pretty useful!
